# PianoRobot
This project is a robot that plays the piano!

It's made of 16 servos, covering 4 octaves in the key of C major. <br>
To play a song, a microSD card with a text file containing the score must be inserted.

It is still work in progress, but nearing completion, and the prototype is functional.

The project consists of a parser that converts the music score into instructions for the robot
and the main loop, which plays the song.
